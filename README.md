Breast Cancer Detection

Overview

This project focuses on detecting breast cancer using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, sourced from Kaggle. The objective is to classify tumors as malignant or benign based on their characteristics.

Dataset

Source: Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset

Features: Various numerical attributes describing tumor characteristics.

Target Variable: Diagnosis (Malignant or Benign).

Project Structure

Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values.

Encoding categorical variables.

Splitting data into training and testing sets.

Feature scaling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Understanding data distribution.

Identifying feature correlations using visualizations (heatmaps, pair plots, etc.).

Model Training & Evaluation

Applying various machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM).

Evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.

Requirements

Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

Usage

Run the Jupyter Notebook to execute the project:

jupyter notebook Project_1_Breast_Cancer_Detection.ipynb

Results

The best-performing model is selected based on evaluation metrics, helping in accurate breast cancer prediction.
